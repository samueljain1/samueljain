## 📌 Overview

**serverless-spot-bridge** is a lightweight, event-driven tool to:
- Monitor EKS cluster demand in real-time
- Automatically attach/detach Spot Instances based on node group load
- Optimize compute costs with no downtime

Powered by **AWS Lambda**, **EventBridge**, and **Golang**, this solution integrates seamlessly with **Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler**.
